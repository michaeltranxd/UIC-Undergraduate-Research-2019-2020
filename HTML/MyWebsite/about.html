          <p class="mali theme7 opacity-75">Hello! My name is Michael Tran and I am a 4th year studying computer science. 
            My interests in computer science relates to game design and software development (mobile or computer).
            However, I have yet to explore many aspects of computer science like cloud computing, 
            data visualization, and much more. I hope to learn a lot about data visualization and
            other parts of computer science that I have never even encountered.</p>

          <p class="mali theme7 opacity-75">Major aside, I have many hobbies outside of school/Computer Science. One of my fun facts is that
              I love cruising on my longboard (I built it using longboard parts). I am learning
              how to play the guitar through YouTube videos since I never grew up playing an instrument.
              In terms of games, I play a lot of games that are free on the market such as,
            <abbr title="Old School Runescape">OSRS</abbr>, <abbr title="League of Legends">League</abbr>,
              and Maplestory. One game that I bought two years ago was Slay the Spire and it is an amazing game.
              The game is a card deck building game in which you use the cards to fight monsters in rooms to continue
              up the tower. Everytime you defeat a level with a monster, you pull 3 cards and can select one or none
              of the cards. There is a lot of strategy and sometimes luck that gets used in the game. I could get into
              more of that, but I think I have been nerding out too much. </p>
