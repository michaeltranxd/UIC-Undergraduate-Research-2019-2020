# UIC-Undergraduate-Research-2019-2020
Undergraduate research under Professor Marai at UIC

# Purpose
To experiment with multiple data visualizations and gain a foundation of data visualization. Then use it to display a anonymized dataset.

# Code
Some of the code examples can be found on observable: https://observablehq.com/collection/@michaeltranxd/uic-research-2019-2020

*I am currently working on transitioning some of the javascript code from this GitHub onto observable so it will be much easier for people to understand and see the examples.*
